The easiest way to get a production grade Kubernetes cluster up and running.

## What is kops?

We like to think of it as `kubectl` for clusters.

`kops` lets you deploy production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes clusters
from the command line.  Deployment is currently supported on Amazon Web
Services (AWS), with more platforms planned.

## Can I see it in action?

## Launching a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS

To replicate the above demo, check out our [tutorial](/docs/aws.md) for
launching a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS.

## Features

* Automate the provisioning of Kubernetes clusters in ([AWS](/docs/aws.md))
* Deploy Highly Available (HA) Kubernetes Masters
* Supports upgrading from [kube-up](/docs/upgrade_from_kubeup.md)
* Built on a state-sync model for **dry-runs** and automatic **idempotency**
* Ability to generate [Terraform configuration](/docs/terraform.md)
* Supports custom [add-ons](/docs/addons.md) for `kubectl`
* Command line [autocompletion](/docs/cli/kops_completion.md)
* Community supported!

## Installing

`kubectl` is required, see [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/).

### OSX From Homebrew (Latest Stable Release)

```console
$ brew update && brew install kops
```

### OSX From Homebrew (HEAD of master)

```console
$ brew update && brew install --HEAD kops
```

### Linux

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest), then:

```console
$ chmod +x kops-linux-amd64                 # Add execution permissions
$ mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops   # Move the kops to /usr/local/bin
```

### From Source

Go 1.7+ and make are required.

```console
$ go get -d k8s.io/kops
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/k8s.io/kops/
$ git checkout release
$ make
```

See [building notes](/docs/build.md) for more information.

At this time, Windows is not a supported platform.

## History

See the [releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases) for more
information on changes between releases.

## Getting involved!

Want to contribute to kops? We would love the extra help from the community. We
have a quickstart guide on [adding a feature](/docs/development/adding_a_feature.md).

Kops also has time set aside every other week to offer help and guidance to the
community. Kops maintainers have agreed to set aside time specifically dedicated
to working with newcomers, helping with PRs, and discussing new features.

We recommend letting us know **beforehand** if you plan on attending so we can
have time to prepare for the call.

## GitHub Issues

#### Bugs

If you think you have found a bug please follow the instructions below.

- Please spend a small amount of time giving due diligence to the issue tracker. Your issue might be a duplicate.
- Set `-v 10` command line option and save the log output. Please paste this into your issue.
- Note the version of kops you are running (from `kops version`), and the command line options you are using
- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/new)
- Remember users might be searching for your issue in the future, so please give it a meaningful title to helps others.
- Feel free to reach out to the kops community on [kubernetes slack](https://github.com/kubernetes/community#slack-chat)

#### Features

We also use the issue tracker to track features. If you have an idea for a feature, or think you can help kops become even more awesome follow the steps below.

- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/new)
- Remember users might be searching for your issue in the future, so please give it a meaningful title to helps others.
- Clearly define the use case, using concrete examples. EG: I type `this` and kops does `that`.
- Some of our larger features will require some design. If you would like to include a technical design for your feature please include it in the issue.
- After the new feature is well understood, and the design agreed upon we can start coding the feature. We would love for you to code it. So please open up a **WIP** *(work in progress)* pull request, and happy coding.
